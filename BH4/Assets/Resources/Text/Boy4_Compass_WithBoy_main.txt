Tuva has been enchanted by the compass, and willingly follows the path she’s been cursed to follow: down a cliff. Suddenly, Fay jumps out of nowhere and grabs the relic from Tuva and throws it away.

At this point, Fay must confess to Tuva that he isn’t a human like she is. He’s an elf who has been banned from his home with the elves and that they “destroyed” his mythical appearance. He offers her his light, but warning her that if she accepts it, she will turn into an elf herself.
