Tuva agrees to help the Lady of the Spring, she melts away a magical ice shard which is blocking the flow of the spring where the Lady lives by tilts mirrors hanging from tree branches and reflects light onto the ice shards. In return, the Lady of the Spring tells Tuva the two paths she can choose to walk: on one of them, Tuva will be able to retrieve her light and on the second path she’ll find her inner light instead.

Tuva must choose which path to take.
