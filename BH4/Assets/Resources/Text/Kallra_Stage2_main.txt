In the case of Tuva accepting to help the Lady of the Spring, she must take away an ice shard which is blocking the flow of the spring where the Lady lives. 
Tuva will succeed if she tilts mirrors hanging from tree branches and reflects light onto the ice shards. In return, the Lady of the Spring will give Tuva two paths to choose from: one path where Tuva will be able to retrieve her light and a second path where she’ll find a new light source from.
