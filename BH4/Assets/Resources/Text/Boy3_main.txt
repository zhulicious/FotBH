Tuva and Fay walk along the foot of a mountain, until they reach a heap of rocks. There they see a troll with three heads up ahead. The heads seems to have an argument among its heads about whether to eat gold or not. 

Meanwhile, Fay steals the golden objects without the trolls knowing. But Tuva does see him and can either continue to divert the trolls attention or scold Fay. 

If Tuva chooses to distract the troll, Fay will get away with taking the gold and Tuva and Fay will continue on thier journey. If she instead scolds Fay, the troll will noticed the robbery and chase her, away from Fay, and into the forest.
