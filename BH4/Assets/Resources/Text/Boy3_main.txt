Tuva and Fay walk along the foot of a mountain, until they reach a heap of rocks. There, they see a group of trolls up ahead, who seem to have a discussion about whether to eat some golden objects or not. 


Meanwhile, Fay steals these golden objects without the trolls knowing. But Tuva does see him and she feels the need to do something about it. 

<i> “They’ve most certainly stole it from somebody else” </i> Fay says while putting the gold objects in his pockets. At this point, Tuva may chose to continue with or without the boy.
