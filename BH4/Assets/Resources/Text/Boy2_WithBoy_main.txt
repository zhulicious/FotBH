The two children walk through the forest to arrive at a grove. 

The boy, named Fay, starts running around, playing. Tuva joins him but soon a party of fairy knaves arrive at the scene. Tuva turns around to look for Fay, but he has hidden somewhere far away. The leader of the knaves walk up to Tuva and ask her if she has seen a dubious acting boy

If Tuva chooses to help the fairy knaves, they will thank her and tell her to go back into the forest. If she instead lies to them and helps the humanlike boy, the knaves will leave and she will meet up with the boy again. They will eventually encounter a troll together.
