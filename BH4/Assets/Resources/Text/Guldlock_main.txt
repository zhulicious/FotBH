As Tuva approaches what seems to be ruins of an old church she stumbles upon a strange little girl. The girl appears to be somewhat human, yet she has features that are reminiscent of trolls. The girl quickly notices that Tuva’s light is fading. “You must retrieve your light, you will stop being human otherwise!” she tells Tuva, and that crosses and iron is good to carry in order to protect herself from evil creatures and beasts. A roaring sound hears from the distance, so the troll-like girl quickly says farewell and runs off.

After walking past the old church, Tuva reaches the foot of a mountain. She can see that there’s a cave up ahead, though, there is a mountain troll guarding it’s entrance. The troll gets annoyed with Tuva when she talks to him. Tuva can either scare him away by ringing the church bells or talk with him until the troll chases her way."
