As Tuva approaches what seems to be ruins of an old church she stumbles upon a strange little girl. The girl appears to be somewhat human, yet she has features that are alike a trolls. The girl quickly notices that Tuva’s light is fading, “You must retrieve your light!” she tells Tuva, and that she must find a religeous item made out of iron in order to protect herself from evil creatures and beasts. <i> A roaring sound hears from the distance, so the troll-like girl quickly says far-well and runs off. </i>

After walking past the old church, Tuva reaches the foot of a mountain. She can see that there’s a cave up ahead, though, there is a mountain troll guarding it’s entrance. The troll tells Tuva in which direction she must go, in order to find Näcken.
