Tuva has been enchanted by the vegvísir the huldra gave her, and follows it blindly to a cliff. Suddenly, Fay jumps out of nowhere and grabs the relic from Tuvas hands. Just as Tuva, he also gets enchanted. Without a second thought he walks off the cliff.

Tuva is now alone and have no other choice then to walk back into the forest.
