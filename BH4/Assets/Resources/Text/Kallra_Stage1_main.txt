Tuva decides to take the path to the glade. When she arrives she finds 
the lady of the spring watching her from it’s spring. The lady of the 
spring conversate with Tuva about her loss of light and tells her that


 it is dangerous for her, she needs to get it back. One thing that can protect her against many creatures is iron and crosses. More than that she can’t tell Tuva, The lady of the spring have her own problems. Tuva can choose to help her or leave which will take her to the memory spirit. If Tuva chose to help she needs to take away an ice plug the fairies have put on the springs watercourse and which keeps the water from flowing into the spring of the lady of the spring. By tilting some of the mirrors the fairies have hanged up on trees, Tuva can reflect light and melt the ice. The lady of the spring becomes very happy and tells Tuva from where she is standing now she can walks many paths, but which one shall she choose? She can either go to where her light is, or to a place she can find light within herself. Which path should she take? If Tuva don’t know which to choose the lady of the spring asks Tuva if she wants it to end there and now which Tuva can answer either yes or chose either her light or the light within herself.
