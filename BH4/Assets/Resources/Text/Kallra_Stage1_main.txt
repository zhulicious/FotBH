Tuva walks down the first path leading to the glade. 

As she arrives, a strange lady is sitting by the spring watching her. As Tuva approaches, the lady commences to tell Tuva about the danger of losing her inner light and that she must get it back unless she wants to turn into the same being who took it. The lady also tells Tuva that religious items, such as an iron crosses, as well as iron, may protect her from many evil creatures. The Lady of the Spring has problems of her own, in which she asks Tuva for help.
