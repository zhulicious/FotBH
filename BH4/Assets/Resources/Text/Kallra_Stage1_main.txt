<i> Tuva walks down the first path leading to the glade. </i>
As she arrives, a strange lady is sitting by the spring watching her. As Tuva approaches, the lady commences to tell Tuva about the danger of losing her inner light and that Tuva must get it back. The lady also tells Tuva that religious iron items, such as an iron cross, may protect her from many evil creatures. The Lady of the Spring has problems of her own, in which she asks Tuva for help.
