After following her current path through the forest, Tuva comes across a Huldra, an enchanting creature who gets annoyed by Tuvas presence. The Huldra will forgive her if Tuva can solve three riddles.

If Tuva answers all of them accordingly, she’ll be rewarded with an item and beeing allowed to pass through her territory. But if she answers them incorrectly, the Huldra will kill her.
