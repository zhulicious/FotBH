As Tuva arrives to a new area, a thick fog slowly starts to cover the ground. As she continues she can feel how the fog gets thicker and thicker. Then, she can see a figure lurking behind the trees. It’s her father! Tuva starts asking many questions, and her father gets more annoyed by the minute until he suddenly fades away.  


Then, another figure shows up, this time it’s Tuva’s mother but she seems a bit different from what Tuva remembered. The sound of a crying baby hears nearby, and Tuva quickly follows the sound. She then sees a crib, where a baby is laying, suddenly it talks and accuses Tuva for not protecting it. The baby tells Tuva to stay and care for her.
