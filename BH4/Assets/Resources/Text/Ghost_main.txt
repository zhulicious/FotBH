As Tuva arrives to a new area, a thick fog slowly starts to cover the ground. All of her hair have now turned white and her skin have begun to take on a blue shade. 

As she continues she can feel how the fog gets thicker and thicker. Then she sees a figure lurking behind the trees. It’s her father! Tuva starts asking many questions, but suddenly her father fades away.  

Then, another figure shows up, this time it’s Tuva’s mother but she seems a bit different from what Tuva remembered. Just like her father she suddenly fades away as well.

The sound of a crying baby hears nearby, and Tuva quickly follows the sound. She then sees a crib, where a infant is laying, suddenly it talks and accuses Tuva for not protecting it. The baby tells Tuva to stay and care for her.

If Tuva chooses to stay, she will go mad and never leave the forest. If she choose to go the infant will fade away just like her parents and Tuva will continue through the forest.
