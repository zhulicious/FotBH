Arriving to the calm and peacefulness of the Lake, Tuva sees  the glimmer of some shiny object hiding beneath the surface of the shore. Tuva tries reaching for it, but is unsuccessful. She gathers items, such as spiderwebs, sticks and a piece from a fishing line from the ground in order to craft a tool to reach the shiny item in the water. 


Suddenly a young woman approaches Tuva and offers her her help. 

Either is Tuva accepts the help or not, the remaining option for Tuva is to continue on a path that will lead her along a stream that descends from the lake she just visited. Eventually Tuva will find herself entering a meadow where the stream turns into a lagoon. She suddenly hears a familiar sound, kind of like a violin. As she gets closer to the edge of the body of water, she sees footprints in the mud that lead straight into the lagoon.
