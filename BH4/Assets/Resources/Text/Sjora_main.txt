Tuva left the Huldras territory and is arriving to the calm and peacefulness of a Lake. Her skin have turned completely blue. Tuva sees the glimmer of some shiny object hiding beneath the surface in the lake. Tuva tries reaching for it, but is unsuccessful. She gathers items, such as spiderwebs, sticks and a piece from a fishing line from the ground in order to craft a tool to reach the shiny item in the water, but to no avail. 

Suddenly a woman approaches Tuva from the water and offers her her help. She also tells her about the weakness of the näck, his violin, where he keeps the light he steals.

Either Tuva accepts the help or not, the remaining option for Tuva being to continue on a path that will lead her along a stream that descends from the lake she just visited. Eventually Tuva will find herself entering a meadow where the stream turns into a pond. She suddenly hears a familiar sound, a violin, that suddenly stops and gets replaced with a splash. As she gets closer to the edge of the body of water, she sees footprints in the mud that lead straight into the pond.

Tuva starts to feel a sudden pain in her chest but it slowly fades away, as if her lungs were changing. It gets harder for her to breathe. She fears she might not have much time left.

Tuva has never swam before. She can decide to face her fears, dive in and find the person she is looking for, or give up and wait until her light is gone and her transformation complete.
