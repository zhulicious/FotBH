Fay and Tuva arrive at a cliff. A party of fairy knaves show up and try to capture Fay. At this point, Fay is forced to confess to Tuva that he isn’t a human like she is. He’s a fairy who has been fleeing from his judgement. 

The fairy knaves offers Tuva to take responsibility for Fays action by becoming a fairy and take care of him.

If Tuva turns down the offer she will turn around and walk away to a lake.
