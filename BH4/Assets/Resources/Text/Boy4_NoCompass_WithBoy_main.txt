Fay and Tuva arrive to a cliff and while they sit down for a break, a party of elves show up and try to capture Fay. At this point, Fay must confess to Tuva that he isn’t a human like she is. He’s an elf who has been banned from his home with the elves and that they “destroyed” his mythical appearance. 

He offers her his light, but warning her that if she accepts it, she will turn into an elf herself.
