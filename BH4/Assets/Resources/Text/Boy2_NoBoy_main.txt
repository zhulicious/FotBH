After walking for a while, Tuva arrives at a grove. All of her hair have now turned white and her skin have begun to take on a blue shade.

At the grove she finds a boy named Fay with humanlike features. He persistently asks Tuva to play a game him. Tuva don't want to play and soon a party of fairy knaves show up. Tuva turns around to look for Fay, but he has hidden somewhere far away. The leader of the fairy knaves walks up to Tuva and asks her if she’s seen a dubious acting boy.

If Tuva chooses to help the fairy knaves, they will thank her and tell her to go back into the forest. If she instead lies to them and helps the humanlike boy, the knaves will leave and she will meet up with the boy again. They will eventually encounter a troll together.
