While walking in the forest, Tuva sees a quite big hill with an enormous tree on top. Suddenly, a loud noise is made, the earth is shaking and what she thought to be a hill with a tree turns into a gigantic moose. 

The giant moose introduces himself as the protector of the forest, and explains to Tuva about her condition without her light, how the lack of it will turn her into the same being who took it, and how advantageous it is for her to have an item made of iron to protect herself from evil creatures and foes. 

The forest protector seems to dislike The Näck, since he’s unbalancing the well-being of the forest. 

After he have spoken to Tuva he lays down to continue his sleep.
