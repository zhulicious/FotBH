The tale starts with a girl named Tuva who’s walking in a forest. 

Soft music is heard in the distance which slowly converts into lovely sounds from a violin. Tuva follows the sound and arrives to a river, where a man is sitting, playing his violin. The sweet music puts Tuva into a trance and she walks into his arms. They start to kiss and he carefully drags her down into the dark water. Tuva’s light slowly fades away. As Tuva’s hair is swept aside by the current, the iron cross she bears around her neck is revealed. The man becomes frightened from what he has seen and let’s go of his grip. Tuva gets carried away by the stream.

Tuva wakes up by the riverbed somewhere deep inside the forest. One of her golden locks have turned white. Ahead of her she finds three paths: the first, leading to a glade, the second going deeper into the woods and lastly a path that seems to lead to the ruins of what once was a church.

Tuva has to choose which to follow.
