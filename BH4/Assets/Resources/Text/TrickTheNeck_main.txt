As Tuva swims around searching for the man with the violin. She finds an underwater cave. She swims inside the cave and gets out of the water. She can hear the music of a violin coming from up ahead. Tuva walks towards the music through a long corridor until she reaches the end of it. The Näck is sitting there, playing his violin.

Tuva needs to trick the näck to get to his violin and break it. If she succeds she will become a human again but if she fails, the näck will take the last of her light and she will turn into a näck herself.
